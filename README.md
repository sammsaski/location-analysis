# Testing + Development
For testing:
1. `cd` into project directory
2. `expo start`
3. connect to application using expo via scanning the QR code 
4. start developing and save constantly to make sure nothing breaks!

For development:
1. make changes
2. `git add <files>`
3. `git commit`
4. `git push -u origin master` (still need to change from master -> main)
